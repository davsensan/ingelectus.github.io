Perhaps at some point your street has been plunged into darkness and you have wondered why all the street lights have gone off. Power distribution grid incidents are not frequent, but they can occur. If there is an incident, the grid operators implement a mechanism to detect and resolve incidents, so everything can return to normal.

But, imagine a smart system capable of precisely ascertaining the real status of the distribution grid at any given time, in order to prevent and resolve problems. This is the aim of the **MONICA Project (Advanced MONItoring and Control of MV AND LV distribution grids)**: to develop a technology that enables low and medium-voltage lines to be monitored and diagnosed immediately, with a similar approach to that used in transport grids, i.e. in high-voltage.

How could this be done? An advanced data acquisition, processing and management platform, called **Grid State Estimator**, will receive real-time data captured by the sensors deployed in 37 MV/LV Substations and by the new smart meters installed in around 15,000 households. Likewise, information will be available concerning the grid topology at any given time (technical characteristics of all the medium and low-voltage sections, substation status and that of any other physical elements of the distribution grid, such as circuit breakers, switchgear, etc.). Not so long ago this system would not have been considered technically or economically feasible.But now it is possible thanks to the deployment of smart grids and the latest advances in related technology such as smart meters (7 million already installed by Endesa) and advanced sensors and remote controls, which have provided the power distribution grid with excellent automation capacities.

These new technologies enable the aim of the MONICA project to be addressed with guarantees: that both low voltage and medium-voltage lines and therefore the Substations that support them and all types of users, whatever the nature thereof, are equipped with the same supervision and control tools as high-voltage grids. This will enable improved quality of services to be provided, **reducing the number of incidents thanks to preventive maintenance and by facilitating the identification and resolution of these incidents**; as well as optimising investments and greater energy efficiency at all levels.

Energy storage, electric vehicles and their charging points, distributed generation or new electricity self-consumption systems, are forcing traditional consumption models to change and therefore the management of these also has to change. The challenge is for the distribution grid to adapt to these new active elements and to be capable of operating in a decentralised and bidirectional manner, interacting with them. Real-time knowledge of the distribution grid provided by MONICA will enable the optimal integration of these new elements, which would be practically impossible with traditional energy models. 

## Sustainable and efficient energy model

With the implementation of these information and communication technologies within the current power grid, we will obtain a smart grid that enables us to offer users a more efficient and sustainable energy model. 

The MONICA Project will be carried out in the Smart City Malaga Living Lab, the Enel Group's real experiment centre for the development of power distribution technologies.

Endesa has headed the consortium that has developed the project, with the collaboration of Ayesa Advanced Technologies, Ingelectus Innovative Electrical Solutions, Ormazábal Media Tensión and the Electrical Engineering Department of the Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering of the University of Seville via the AICIA foundation.The total budget exceeds 3 million euros, around 1.3 million euros of which are financed by the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) and the EU ERDF Funds; it forms part of the Interconnect program and it is endorsed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.
