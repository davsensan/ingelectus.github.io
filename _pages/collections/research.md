# Smart Grids

## [MONICA](/research/monica/){:class="text-dark"}

Imagine a smart system capable of precisely ascertaining the real status of the distribution grid at any given time, in order to prevent and resolve problems. This is the aim of the MONICA Project (Advanced Monitoring and Control of MV and LV Distribution Grids): to develop a technology that enables low and medium-voltage lines to be monitored and diagnosed immediately.
